        <h1 style="margin-top: 50px;">Reflection Essay</h1>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin: 10px 200px;">
            As a student in my English 1101 college-level class, I have learned many valuable lessons and skills that will undoubtedly aid me in my future endeavours. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Thesis: ENGL 1101 increased my understanding of professional writing and helped me articulate my thoughts professionally.
            <br>
            <br>
            In my home country, we were taught English only as a foreign language. We didn’t learn much about the practical applications of English writing. But in ENGL 1101, One of the most important things I learned was the different writing practices, like MLA, headings, introduction paragraphs, thesis statements, and conclusion paragraphs.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, I gained valuable skills in research and citation. Through various assignments, I learned how to locate and evaluate sources, properly incorporate them into my writing, and correctly cite them according to the appropriate style guide. The third essay helped me understand them better because it was my first time adding them seriously into an essay. This skill will be crucial in my future academic research as in machine learning, we have to use programs made by different people, and we have to cite them, so this knowledge will be crucial for my work.
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the critical lessons I learned in this class was the importance of clarity and concision in writing. Before taking this class, I often used complex sentence structures and jargon to sound more professional. However, I quickly learned that this could hinder the effectiveness of my writing. Through various writing assignments and exercises, I learned how to simplify my language and convey my ideas without sacrificing the depth of my message.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, I learned about rhetorical writing to convince the reader towards a narrative. I applied this practice at an organisation; It was an Instagram handle for which I made posts.
            <br>
            <br>
            Furthermore, I understood the importance of revision in writing. I used to think that writing a first draft and submitting it was enough, but my instructor emphasised the importance of revising and editing to improve the overall quality of my work. It helped me develop a critical eye for my writing and allowed me to catch errors and make improvements before turning in my final drafts.
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, English 1101 helped me learn some daily life use cases of English writing. It helped me develop a professional bio, resume, and CV. She showed so many examples, and I made my resume, CV, and bio perfect after the review session in class because of the multiple reviews. I also got some more ideas for betterment. For the initial development of the bio, resume and CV, the class examples helped me so much.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall, my English 1101 class has been precious in improving my writing, communication, and thinking. The concepts and skills I have learned will be helpful in various settings, both in my academic and professional endeavors.
